# Generative-Adversarial-Network
Developed a GAN model using TensorFlow to produce realistic images that resemble a custom dataset.
• Created a generator model utilizing deep neural networks to craft realistic images from random noise.Simultaneously, designed
a discriminator model to effectively differentiate between synthesized and genuine images.
• Employed GAN architecture, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Batch Normalization, Leaky ReLU activation, and Binary
Cross-Entropy loss.
